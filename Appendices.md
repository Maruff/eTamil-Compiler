### Appendix A: Glossary of Terms

This glossary provides definitions for key terms and concepts used throughout the book, helping readers better understand the material and its context.

- **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**: A tree representation of the abstract syntactic structure of source code, where each node represents a construct in the language.
  
- **Back-End**: The portion of a compiler responsible for optimizing intermediate code and generating machine code.

- **Cross-Compilation**: The process of compiling code on one platform (host) to be executed on another platform (target).

- **Domain-Specific Language (DSL)**: A programming language specialized for a specific application domain, providing specific constructs and optimizations relevant to that domain.

- **Intermediate Representation (IR)**: A code representation used between the front-end and back-end stages of compilation. It is lower-level than source code but higher-level than machine code.

- **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation**: A method of compilation where code is compiled at runtime rather than ahead of time, allowing for dynamic optimizations based on runtime information.

- **Lexical Analysis**: The process of converting a sequence of characters in source code into a sequence of tokens, which represent meaningful symbols in the language.

- **LLVM (Low-Level Virtual Machine)**: A compiler framework used for building compilers, providing tools for intermediate code generation, optimization, and code generation for multiple architectures.

- **Optimization**: The process of improving code to make it run faster, use less memory, or reduce power consumption, often without changing its external behavior.

- **Parsing**: The process of analyzing the syntax of a sequence of tokens to produce a structured representation, typically an abstract syntax tree.

- **Semantic Analysis**: The phase of compilation where the compiler checks the AST for semantic correctness, ensuring that the program follows the rules of the language.

- **Three-Address Code (TAC)**: An intermediate code form where each instruction has at most three operands, typically used in the intermediate representation.

- **Vectorization**: The process of converting scalar operations into vector operations, allowing multiple data elements to be processed simultaneously.
